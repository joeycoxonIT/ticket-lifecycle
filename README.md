<p>
NOTE: If you haven't yet, delete the "Maintenance" department so that tickets don't get sent there. To do this go to Admin Panel -> Agents -> Departments, then make sure "Maintenance" is checked. Click "More" on the right side of the screen to see a drop-down list, then click "Delete".

<h3>1) Intake</h3>
<p>

- An end user creates a ticket (in this case the entire mobile/online banking system is down)
  - NOTE: in some cases, you the agent will create the ticket on the user's behalf.

<p>
  
- The Support Agent logs in to see if there are any open tickets

</p>
<p>
  
- The Support Agent then reads the ticket and addresses the issue
- If the ticket is unclear on the severity of the issue, the support agent will then contact the user for clarification so they can make a more informed decision on how to proceed
- The Support Agent will then update the SLA depending on the severity, then will assign the ticket to either himself, another agent, or department to solve the issue

<h3>3) Working the Issue</h3>
<p>
- While working the issue, the person the ticket is assigned to (in this case, the SysAdmin) should be constantly providing updates about troubleshooting and any new information about the issue at hand.

<br />

<h3>4) Resolution</h3>
<p>
  
- At this point, the person working the ticket has addressed the issue and implemented a solution
- The assignee will then confirm with the user that the issue has been resolved
- If the first solution does not work, then the assignee will continue troubleshooting and working to resolve the issue
- Once the solution works, the assignee will document any details that have not been noted, then will change the ticket's status to "Closed".
